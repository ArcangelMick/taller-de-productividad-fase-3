<p>Welcome. WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we&rsquo;re dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>

<h2>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.
	<ol>
		<li>If for some reason this doesn&rsquo;t work, don&rsquo;t worry. It doesn&rsquo;t work on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>
		<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
		<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your site. If there is an error, double check your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/" title="WordPress support">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
